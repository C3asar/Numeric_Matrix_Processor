## Numeric_Matrix_Processor
# This project was given as a challenge on JetBrains Academy!
On my way to complete the Python Developer path i was asked to work on this project,
it was quit challenging because i've never worked with the matrices,
so it was an opportunity for me to dig deep in this subject and accomplishtwo goals at once.
